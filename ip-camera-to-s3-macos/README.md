Battery-efficient RTSP video capture and S3 upload utility optimized for macOS (Apple Silicon). Records IP camera feeds and automatically uploads segments to S3-compatible storage using hardware-accelerated encoding.

## Features

- Hardware-accelerated H.264 encoding using Apple Silicon's media engine (VideoToolbox)
- Efficient battery usage through hardware encoding
- Automatic upload to S3-compatible storage (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, etc.)
- Configurable recording segments
- Auto-recovery from network interruptions
- Clean temporary file management

## Performance

- Uses Apple Silicon's hardware encoding for optimal battery life
- Minimal CPU overhead (~7-8% CPU usage)
- Minimal storage required: collects Â±60GB in a month
- Zero GPU utilization
- Efficient memory management

## Requirements

- ffmpeg
- macOS running on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)
- Node.js 16+
- IP Camera with RTSP support
- S3-compatible storage access
