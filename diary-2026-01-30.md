the idea of having a personal online datastore that shares datapoints between apps is a compelling one. we currently have online drives like google drive and dropbox, but data is unstructured. also we have SaaS products that put some of our data online, but our personal data is scattered across different apps, and a graphical user interface for humans only is required to get the data out. what if we had a personal online datastore that was able to give apps access to its file system securely on a least-privilige basis, and interact with this data with different interfaces? this is what [solid is about](https://solidproject.org/about). its also what i try to speedrun in [agent-pod](https://github.com/janwilmake/agent-pod).

at its core, we need an online file system. as im a big cloudflare fan for its serverless nature, my focus immediately went to durable objects. [xytext](https://github.com/janwilmake/agent-pod/tree/main/xytext) was a frist experiement of having a file system that can be efficiently viewed and searched through, because it stores file contents in a sqlite database. however, this doesn't immediately solve having binary files, so another option would be to use a cloudflare r2 bucket for storing the actual files. a bucket can pretty much have infinite storage, and we can listen to [events](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/event-notifications/) to create an index. if a user gets to store files in `/Users/{userid}/**`, we can store its index in durable object with name `/Users/{userId}`. having all available paths here would allow more easily searching over a large amount of files.

after we have the file system, there should be a permission system. which apps or agents and which users can access which data? a permission system should make this possible. think a dialog when you install a new app. but also one place where you can manage these permissions later and have a clear overview of what has access to what.

last but not least, apps and agents need to be built with the ability to alter the file system and create or manipulate data. the key friction point here is that if we want these apps to be accessible, they should be able to be installed with a single oauth flow. you don't want to have to also connect it to your datapod first, as this would require a lot of extra clicks. do we make the datapod optional? this way, people can more easily adopt solid apps.
