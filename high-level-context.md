# High level X context:

1. - your follows
2. - all your posts/comments/reposts on X with full context around it
3. - ability to pay for tracking any profile: just posts/comments and context around it.
4. - ability for tracking DMs too. need $200/m plan for this.

With that context, there should be an ability to easily create filters on it via a fast hybrid search.

There should be separation between the approval of the persons data and the person paying for it.

Simple questions that you should be able to answer:

- Who are the 10 most interesting people I know around this topic: X?
- What are recent posts from people I follow around this topic: X?
- What are posts of opinions around this company: X?

# High level GitHub context:

- all your repos with metadata like in dashboard.forgithub.com
- cache context each repo
- ability to pay for inferences on the repos

I have already got a lot of this built out, just never got around to making it an enterprise product yet. Easy payments has been the biggest blocker.
